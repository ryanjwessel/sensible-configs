E.g. $ opencollective webpack donate 5 monthly\n\n    $ opencollective postinstall [--plain]\n    \nReads the details of your collective in the `package.json` of the current directory and invite the user to donate after installing your package.\nAdd this command in the `postinstall` script of your `package.json`.\n\n![](https://cl.ly/0u2a0z0Y3X37/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-24%20at%202.37.46%20PM.png)\n\nIf you add the `--plain` option, it won't show any emoji and ascii art (better for old terminals).\n\n    $ opencollective setup\n\nInteractive setup to add your collective info into your `package.json` and add the backers/sponsors badge and avatars in your `README.md`.\n\n\n## Coming soon\n\n    $ opencollective login\n    \n    $ opencollective logout\n    \n    $ opencollective cc | billing\n    \n    $ opencollective cc ls\n    $ opencollective cc add\n    $ opencollective cc rm\n    \n    $ opencollective apply [github_repo_url]\n    \n    $ opencollective show <collective>\n    $ opencollective open <collective>\n    \n    $ opencollective ls // list the collectives you are contributing to.\n\n    \nStop your contribution to <collective>. Warning: may make someone sad somewhere on this planet.\n\n## Credits\n\nShamelessly inspired by the excellent [now-cli](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli)",
