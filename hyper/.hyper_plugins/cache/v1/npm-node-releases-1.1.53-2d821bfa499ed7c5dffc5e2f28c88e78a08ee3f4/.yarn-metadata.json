Each version in this file contains only necessary info: version, release date and optionally LTS flag.\n\n## Installation\n```bash\nnpm install --save node-releases\n```\n\n## Updating data\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\nThis is a build script which fetches data from web, processes it and saves processed data to `data/processed/envs.json`. If you want to run this steps separately you can use commands described below.\n\n\n### Fetching data\n```bash\nnpm run fetch\n```\nThis npm script will download new data to `data/raw` directory. Also it'll download Node.js release schedule into `release-schedule` folder.\n\n### Processing data\n```bash\nnpm run process\n```\nThis script generates `envs.json` file from raw data files and saves it to `data/processed` directory.\n",
