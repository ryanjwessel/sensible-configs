Since `process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags` is based on [`NODE_OPTIONS`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_options_options) (introduced in v8.0.0), the set of supported flags for versions older than v8.0.0 is *highly theoretical*.\n- Version ranges are matched using [semver](https://npm.im/semver).\n- This module is granular to the *minor* Node.js version number; *patch* version numbers are not considered.\n- Results for unmaintained (odd) versions of Node.js are based on data for the most recent LTS version; e.g., running this module against Node.js v7.10.0 will yield the same results as would v6.14.0.\n- Prior art: @ljharb's [util.promisify](https://npm.im/util.promisify)\n\n## Maintainers\n\n[@boneskull](https://github.com/boneskull)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright Â© 2018 Christopher Hiller.
